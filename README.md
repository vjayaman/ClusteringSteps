ClusteringSteps
(1) Open ClusteringSteps with jupyter notebook

(2) Move the json input file you're working with into ClusteringSteps

(3) Edit the line in run_grapetree_clustering, so the json, tsv (input, output, respectively) files are appropriately named. Then run this line. The output file should appear in the same directory.
